			"text": "By Carla Jiménez, Staff Reporter A thunderous explosion ripped through the early morning calm in Lower Manhattan yesterday, reducing the historic Macallister Building to rubble and sending a column of smoke and dust billowing into the sky. Authorities believe a natural gas leak was the likely cause. The blast occurred at approximately 4:38 a.m. Sunday morning. Witnesses as far as Canal Street reported being jolted awake by the explosion, which shattered windows and triggered car alarms for blocks around. Fire crews arrived within minutes to find the five-story brownstone completely collapsed, with flames licking at the twisted wreckage. “It was like an earthquake, and then a bomb went off,” said Kenneth Walters, 47, who lives in a building across the street. “I looked out the window and the Macallister was just... gone.” Twelve Missing, Including Artist-in-Residence At least twelve residents are unaccounted for and presumed dead, according to the FDNY. Among them is local artist Abigail Wright, 29, known in the downtown art scene for her surrealist oil paintings and mixed-media installations. Wright reportedly lived on the fifth floor and had not been seen in several days. “It’s a tragedy,” said Battalion Chief Robert Meeker. “We’ve got crews working around the clock to recover remains and investigate what happened. The scene is unstable, so it’s slow going.” Neighbors and former tenants described the Macallister Building as a “bohemian warren” of creatives and eccentric professionals, many of whom had lived there for years. The building, originally constructed in 1897, had a checkered history, including rumors of structural issues, haphazard renovations, and a long-abandoned basement level reportedly sealed in the 1970s. Preliminary Cause: Gas Leak According to Con Edison spokesperson Jamie Gertz, early evidence points to a gas leak originating from the basement utility lines. “We’re working with the FDNY and Department of Buildings to confirm the source,” Gertz said. “At this point, there’s no indication of foul play.” However, building records obtained by The Chronicle reveal multiple code violations filed in the past five years, including complaints about strange odors, faulty wiring, and illegal sub-partitions on the upper floors. City officials have ordered a full safety review of similar pre-war buildings in the area.",
